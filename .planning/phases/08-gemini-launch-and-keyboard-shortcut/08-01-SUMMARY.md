# Phase 08 Plan 01: Gemini Launch and Keyboard Shortcut Summary

**One-liner:** Keyboard shortcut via `_execute_action` command (Cmd+Shift+G / Ctrl+Shift+G) added to manifest.json and version bumped to 1.5.0 for the Gemini-inclusive release.

## What Was Built

Added Chrome keyboard shortcut support to the TrackPull extension by inserting a `commands` section with `_execute_action` in `src/manifest.json`. This reserved command name instructs Chrome to open the extension popup when the shortcut is pressed — no background.js handler needed. Version bumped to 1.5.0 in both `src/manifest.json` and `package.json`. Rebuilt dist to propagate changes.

Gemini AI launch was already fully implemented (`AI_URLS` map in `popup.ts`, dropdown in `popup.html`) — this release makes it official.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Add commands section and bump version in manifest.json | 63c386e | src/manifest.json |
| 2 | Bump version in package.json | e67885e | package.json |
| 3 | Build, test, and verify dist output | 708827b | dist/manifest.json |

## Verification Results

- src/manifest.json has `"version": "1.5.0"` — PASS
- src/manifest.json has `commands._execute_action` with `Ctrl+Shift+G` (default) and `Command+Shift+G` (mac) — PASS
- src/manifest.json has `description: "Open TrackPull"` inside `_execute_action` — PASS
- src/manifest.json has no new `host_permissions` entries — PASS
- src/manifest.json has no `"global": true` on command — PASS
- package.json has `"version": "1.5.0"` — PASS
- dist/manifest.json has `_execute_action` and `"1.5.0"` after rebuild — PASS
- popup.ts still has `"Gemini": "https://gemini.google.com"` in AI_URLS — PASS
- popup.html still has `<option value="Gemini">Gemini</option>` — PASS
- Build succeeds with no errors — PASS
- All 247 tests pass across 13 files — PASS
- No TypeScript files modified (manifest-only release) — PASS

## Decisions Made

1. **`_execute_action` reserved command:** Chrome's reserved `_execute_action` name natively opens the extension popup when the shortcut fires. No background.js handler required — simpler and more reliable than a custom command name.

2. **No host_permissions for Gemini:** The clipboard-first AI launch flow copies data to clipboard then opens the target URL in a new tab. Page-level access to gemini.google.com is not needed, so no permission re-approval is triggered for existing users.

3. **Shortcut choice Cmd+Shift+G / Ctrl+Shift+G:** Cmd+Shift+T is Chrome-reserved ("Reopen closed tab") and silently fails as a shortcut. G was chosen as a mnemonic for "Golf" and is unoccupied in Chrome's reserved set.

## Deviations from Plan
