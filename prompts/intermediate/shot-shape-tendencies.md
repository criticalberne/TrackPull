# Shot Shape Tendencies

**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Goal:** Understand your typical shot shape by analyzing face angle, club path, and curvature data, and get suggestions for corrections.

## How to Use

1. Export your CSV from TrackPull
2. Open ChatGPT or Claude and either:
   - **Drag and drop** your CSV file into the chat window (easiest), or
   - **Paste** your CSV data directly into the prompt where indicated
3. Copy the prompt below and send it along with your data

```
I want to understand my shot shape tendencies using my launch monitor data. Please:

1. Calculate my average face angle, club path, and face-to-path for each club (or overall if club isn't specified)
2. Determine my predominant shot shape (draw, fade, pull, push, slice, hook, straight)
3. Explain the relationship between my face angle and club path — what's causing my ball flight
4. Identify if my shot shape changes between different clubs (e.g., draw with irons, fade with driver)
5. Look at my Side and Curve columns to quantify how much the ball is moving offline
6. Suggest 1-2 specific things I could work on to improve my consistency or reduce unwanted curvature

For reference:
- Positive club path = in-to-out (draws for right-handed)
- Negative club path = out-to-in (fades for right-handed)
- Face angle is relative to target at impact

My shot data is included below (or attached as a CSV file).

## Tips for Reading the Response

- **Face angle controls starting direction** — where the ball launches relative to target
- **Club path influences curve** — the difference between face and path (face-to-path) determines how much the ball curves
- A consistent face-to-path is more important than zeroing everything out — predictable is playable
- If your shot shape flips between clubs, it often means the longer clubs amplify a swing tendency
- Small face-to-path numbers (under 3°) are manageable; larger numbers (5°+) make distance control harder
