# Shaft Flex Analysis

**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Goal:** Determine the right shaft flex and weight based on your club speed, launch angle, and spin characteristics.

## How to Use

1. Export your CSV from TrackPull
2. Open ChatGPT or Claude and either:
   - **Drag and drop** your CSV file into the chat window (easiest), or
   - **Paste** your CSV data directly into the prompt where indicated
3. Copy the prompt below and send it along with your data

I want to figure out if I'm playing the right shaft flex and weight based on my launch monitor data. Please:

1. Look at my driver and iron club speeds and categorize them (slow, moderate, fast, very fast)
2. Based on club speed, recommend a shaft flex (L, A, R, S, X) for both driver and irons
3. Analyze my launch angle and spin rate — if spin is too high, suggest stiffer/heavier; if too low, suggest lighter/softer
4. Comment on whether my ball speed relative to club speed (smash factor) suggests a shaft timing issue
5. Recommend a general shaft weight range (e.g., 55-65g for driver, 95-105g for irons)
6. Note if there's a big inconsistency in my data that suggests the current shaft isn't a good fit

My shot data is included below (or attached as a CSV file).

## Tips for Reading the Response

- **Shaft flex** primarily relates to club speed — but launch and spin patterns reveal whether your current shaft loads and unloads efficiently
- **Too much spin + high launch** can mean a shaft that's too soft, causing the clubhead to arrive with excess dynamic loft
- **Low smash factor** might indicate a shaft that's too heavy or stiff, making it hard to find center face
- Shaft weight affects tempo and control — heavier isn't always better, lighter isn't always faster
- This analysis gives a starting range — the final answer requires hitting different shafts on a monitor
