# Distance Gapping Analysis

**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Goal:** Identify carry distance gaps and overlaps between clubs to ensure even yardage coverage across your bag.

## How to Use

1. Export your CSV from TrackPull
2. Open ChatGPT or Claude and either:
   - **Drag and drop** your CSV file into the chat window (easiest), or
   - **Paste** your CSV data directly into the prompt where indicated
3. Copy the prompt below and send it along with your data

I want to analyze the distance gapping in my golf bag using launch monitor data. Please:

1. Calculate my average carry distance for each club
2. Show the yardage gap between consecutive clubs (e.g., 7-iron to 8-iron)
3. Flag any gaps larger than 15 yards (where I'm missing coverage)
4. Flag any overlaps where two clubs carry the same distance
5. Suggest specific adjustments — should I add a club, remove one, or adjust lofts?
6. Present the results in a table: Club | Avg Carry | Gap to Next Club

Assume standard club ordering: Driver, 3W, 5W/Hybrid, 4i through PW, gap wedge, sand wedge, lob wedge. Only include clubs that appear in the data.

My shot data is included below (or attached as a CSV file).

## Tips for Reading the Response

- **Ideal gap** between irons is 10-15 yards; wedges can be tighter (8-12 yards)
- **Large gaps** (15+ yards) mean you're forced to hit awkward half-shots at those distances
- **Overlaps** mean you're carrying two clubs that do the same job — one could be swapped
- Pay attention to the top of the bag (long irons/hybrids) — this is where most amateurs have the biggest gaps
- If your wedge gaps are uneven, consider bending lofts or switching to a different wedge setup
