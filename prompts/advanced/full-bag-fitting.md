I want a comprehensive golf bag fitting analysis based on my launch monitor data. Please provide a full report covering every aspect of my game:

## 1. Player Profile
- Categorize my swing speed tier (slow/moderate/fast/very fast) for driver and irons
- Assess my overall consistency (standard deviation of carry, face angle, club path)
- Identify my skill level based on dispersion, smash factor, and delivery metrics

## 2. Driver Fitting
- Evaluate launch angle, spin rate, and ball speed for optimal carry
- Recommend driver loft (adjustable setting), shaft flex, shaft weight, and profile (low/mid/high launch)
- Suggest head characteristics (high MOI, low spin, adjustable, draw bias, etc.)
- Note if my attack angle suggests tee height or ball position changes

## 3. Fairway Woods & Hybrids
- Analyze performance and recommend how many FWs/hybrids I should carry
- Identify if any long irons should be replaced with hybrids based on carry distance and consistency

## 4. Iron Fitting
- Recommend iron category (game improvement, players distance, players, blade)
- Suggest shaft flex, weight, and material (steel vs graphite)
- Evaluate whether my current launch and spin are appropriate for holding greens
- Recommend any loft bending if gaps are uneven

## 5. Wedge Setup
- Analyze wedge distances and recommend number of wedges and loft spacing
- Evaluate spin rates for greenside control

## 6. Distance Gapping
- Build a full carry distance table for every club
- Flag all gaps >15 yards and overlaps
- Recommend the optimal 14-club bag configuration

## 7. Shot Shape & Dispersion
- Summarize tendencies (draw/fade/straight) and consistency
- Recommend any equipment changes to manage shot shape (offset, CG position, shaft tip stiffness)

## 8. Priority Recommendations
- Rank the top 5 equipment changes by expected impact on my game
- Separate equipment fixes from swing fixes

Present the full report with tables where appropriate. Be specific with recommendations (e.g., "stiff flex, 65g, mid-launch shaft" not just "stiffer shaft").

My shot data is included below (or attached as a CSV file).

## Tips for Reading the Response

- This is the most comprehensive prompt — expect a long, detailed response
- **Priority recommendations** at the end are the most actionable section — start there
- Equipment changes that match your swing are more effective than fighting your tendencies
- The AI may suggest specific brand/model examples — treat these as category suggestions rather than exact prescriptions, since it won't know current inventory or pricing
- Use this analysis as a guide for a professional fitting session — bring it with you to give the fitter a head start
- If possible, run this prompt with data from multiple sessions to give the AI a more representative picture of your game
