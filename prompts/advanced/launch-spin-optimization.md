# Launch & Spin Optimization

**Skill Level:** Advanced
**Goal:** Compare your launch angle and spin rate against optimal windows for each club and identify loft or shaft changes to maximize distance.

## How to Use

1. Export your CSV from TrackPull
2. Open ChatGPT or Claude and either:
   - **Drag and drop** your CSV file into the chat window (easiest), or
   - **Paste** your CSV data directly into the prompt where indicated
3. Copy the prompt below and send it along with your data

I want to optimize my launch conditions for maximum carry distance using my launch monitor data. Please perform a detailed analysis:

1. For each club in my data, calculate the average launch angle, spin rate, ball speed, and carry distance
2. Compare my launch angle and spin rate to the optimal window for my ball speed. Use these general optimal ranges as reference:
   - Driver: 10-14° launch, 2000-2700 rpm spin (varies with ball speed)
   - Fairway woods: 12-16° launch, 3500-4500 rpm
   - Long irons/hybrids (3-5): 13-17° launch, 4000-5500 rpm
   - Mid irons (6-8): 17-22° launch, 5500-7500 rpm
   - Short irons (9-PW): 23-30° launch, 8000-10000 rpm
   - Wedges: 28-36° launch, 9000-11000 rpm
3. Identify clubs where I'm leaving distance on the table due to non-optimal launch/spin
4. For each underperforming club, suggest whether the fix is:
   - Loft adjustment (stronger or weaker)
   - Shaft change (stiffer/softer to alter spin)
   - Swing change (attack angle, strike location)
5. Present a summary table: Club | Ball Speed | Launch | Spin | Carry | Optimal Launch | Optimal Spin | Delta

My shot data is included below (or attached as a CSV file).

## Tips for Reading the Response

- **Higher ball speed = lower optimal spin** — fast swingers need less spin to stay in the air; slower swingers need more
- **Launch and spin work together** — high launch + low spin is the distance combo for driver, but irons need spin to stop on greens
- If your driver spin is above 3000 rpm with adequate speed, you're likely losing 10+ yards of carry
- Loft adjustments are the quickest fix — a 1° loft change can shift spin by 200-300 rpm
- Attack angle has a huge effect on driver launch/spin — hitting up 3-5° reduces spin significantly
