# Understanding Your Numbers

**Skill Level:** Beginner
**Goal:** Learn what each metric in your shot data means and how your numbers compare to average golfers.

## How to Use

1. Export your CSV from TrackPull
2. Open ChatGPT or Claude and either:
   - **Drag and drop** your CSV file into the chat window (easiest), or
   - **Paste** your CSV data directly into the prompt where indicated
3. Copy the prompt below and send it along with your data

I'm a golfer trying to understand my shot data from a launch monitor session. Below is my data in CSV format. Please:

1. Explain what each column/metric means in plain language
2. Tell me which numbers are most important to pay attention to
3. Compare my averages to typical amateur golfers
4. Highlight anything that stands out — good or bad
5. Give me 2-3 simple takeaways I can focus on

My shot data is included below (or attached as a CSV file).

## Tips for Reading the Response

- **Club Speed & Ball Speed** are your power numbers — higher is longer
- **Smash Factor** tells you how well you're hitting the center of the face (1.45+ for driver is solid)
- **Spin Rate** affects how the ball flies — too high and you lose distance, too low and the ball won't hold greens
- **Carry vs Total** — carry is how far the ball flies, total includes roll
- **Side/Curve** — these tell you how straight (or not) your shots are
- Don't worry about understanding every metric at once — focus on the 2-3 the AI highlights for you
